                The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan.<br>
                Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second installment of Nolan's The Dark<br>
                Knight Trilogy and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale and supported by Michael<br>
                Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman. In the film,<br>
                Bruce Wayne / Batman (Bale), Police Lieutenant James Gordon (Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent<br>
                (Eckhart) form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City, but are menaced by an anarchistic<br>
                mastermind known as the Joker (Ledger), who seeks to undermine Batman's influence and throw the city into anarchy.<br>
                <br>
                Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut in 1940, the 1988 graphic novel The<br>
                Killing Joke, and the 1996 series The Long Halloween, which retold Harvey Dent's origin. The "Dark Knight"<br>
                nickname was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.[4][5] The<br>
                Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago, as well as in several other locations in the United States,<br>
                the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong. The film was the first mainstream feature to partially utilize IMAX 70<br>
                mm cameras, with Nolan using them for 28 minutes of the film, including the Joker's first appearance.<br>
                Warner Bros. initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight, developing promotional<br>
                websites and trailers highlighting screenshots of Ledger as the Joker. Ledger died on January 22, 2008,<br>
                some months after he completed filming and six months before the film's release from a toxic combination<br>
                of prescription drugs, leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public.<br>
                <br>
                Considered one of the best films of its decade and one of the greatest and most influential superhero<br>
                films of all time, the film received critical acclaim for its screenplay, visual effects, musical score,<br>
                mature themes, performances (particularly Ledger's), cinematography, action sequences and direction. The<br>
                film also set numerous records during its theatrical run.[6] The Dark Knight appeared on 287 critics'<br>
                top-ten lists, more than any other film of 2008 with the exception of WALL-E, and more critics (77) named<br>
                The Dark Knight the best film released that year.[7] With over $1 billion in revenue worldwide, it became<br>
                the fourth-highest-grossing film at the time, and highest-grossing film of 2008; it also set the record<br>
                for highest-grossing domestic opening with $158 million, a record it held for three years.[8] At the 81st<br>
                Academy Awards, the film received eight nominations; it won the award for Best Sound Editing and Ledger<br>
                was posthumously awarded Best Supporting Actor.[9] In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the<br>
                United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, or<br>
                aesthetically significant",[10] becoming the second superhero film after 1978's Superman to earn the honor.<br>
                The Dark Knight Rises, the final film in the trilogy, was released in 2012.<br>
